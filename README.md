# makeheaderspp
Automatic header generation for C++ classes

### Motivation
The tool auto-generates class method declarations in C++ headers from their implementation. 
It generates only user-defined parts of a header, while the remaining lines are edited conventionally. 

### Use model
A single dummy macro
```
#define MHPP(arg)
``` 
needs to be defined to tag sections of the code. As it is empty, it has no side effects on compiler or IDE.

The implementation of a new C++ function `myMethod` in a class `myClass` is marked as follows:
```
MHPP("public") 
int myClass::myMethod(int myArg){} // this could be in myClass.cpp
```

A conventional header file is set up e.g. myClass.h, and a section is marked for autogeneration as follows:
```
class myClass{ // this could be in myClass.h
    // here: any contents outside autogeneration
    MHPP("begin myClass") // === autogenerated code. Do not edit === 
    MHPP("end myClass")
    // here: more content outside autogeneration
};
```

Running 
```
makeheaderpp.exe myClass.cpp myClass.h
```
fills in the declaration:
```
class myClass{ // this could be in myClass.h
    // here: any contents outside autogeneration
    MHPP("begin myClass") // === autogenerated code. Do not edit === 
    public:
        myMethod(int myArg);
    MHPP("end myClass")
    // here: more content outside autogeneration
};
```

### Method variations
The following keywords are recognized in MHPP("..."):
* public
* protected
* private
* static
* virtual

The following types of class methods are supported:
* regular function
* static function
* constructor
* destructor
* operator

In case a given construct cannot be autogenerated for whatever reason, add it manually to the non-generated section of its respective header. 

### Supported qualifiers (after arguments list)
* const
* noexcept

### Notes:
The tool attempts to be failsafe and rewrites files only when all checks have passed (note: the redundant class name in `MHPP("begin myClass") ... MHPP("end myClass")`is one of them). 

However, modifying files in-place is by nature somewhat risky. 

Use git, commit often.

The C preprocessor is not invoked, therefore the MHPP(...) tag and the function definition need to be recognizable from the unprocessed source.
